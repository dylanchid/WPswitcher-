# Background Changer Architecture

## Overview

The Background Changer application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and performant.

## Core Components

### WallpaperCache

The `WallpaperCache` class implements a centralized caching system using `NSCache` for both metadata and images. It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure a single cache instance across the application.

#### Key Features:
- Memory-efficient caching with size limits
- Separate caches for metadata and images
- Automatic cache eviction
- Thread-safe operations

### WallpaperItem

The `WallpaperItem` struct represents a single wallpaper with lazy loading capabilities. It implements the `Identifiable` and `Codable` protocols for persistence and UI integration.

#### Key Features:
- Lazy loading of metadata and images
- Automatic caching through `WallpaperCache`
- Error handling and propagation
- File validation

### WallpaperManager

The `WallpaperManager` class manages wallpaper collections and provides background processing capabilities. It follows the Singleton pattern and implements the `ObservableObject` protocol for SwiftUI integration.

#### Key Features:
- Background processing for heavy operations
- State management and persistence
- Playlist management
- Display settings management

## Data Flow

### Wallpaper Loading

1. User selects wallpapers
2. `WallpaperManager` creates `WallpaperItem` instances
3. Metadata is loaded lazily when needed
4. Images are loaded lazily when displayed
5. Both metadata and images are cached

### Cache Management

1. Cache checks are performed before loading
2. Cache hits return immediately
3. Cache misses trigger disk loading
4. Loaded items are cached for future use
5. Cache is cleared on memory warnings

### Background Processing

1. Heavy operations are offloaded to background threads
2. Results are synchronized back to the main thread
3. UI updates are performed on the main thread
4. Error handling is propagated to the UI

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Metadata cache is larger (1000 entries) as it's lightweight
- Image cache is smaller (100 images) to manage memory usage
- Cache limits can be adjusted based on system resources
- Cache is cleared on memory warnings

### Lazy Loading

- Metadata is loaded only when needed
- Images are loaded only when displayed
- Both are cached for subsequent access
- Background preloading for visible items

### Background Processing

- Wallpaper addition is performed in background
- Metadata loading is performed in background
- Image loading is performed in background
- Cache management is performed in background

## Error Handling

### Error Types

- `WallpaperError`: Base error type for wallpaper operations
- `WallpaperManagerError`: Error type for manager operations
- `CacheError`: Error type for cache operations

### Error Propagation

- Errors are propagated up the call stack
- UI layer handles error presentation
- Retry mechanisms are provided where appropriate
- Error logging is implemented

## UI Integration

### SwiftUI Views

- `WallpaperThumbnailView`: Displays wallpaper thumbnails
- `LoadingErrorView`: Handles loading states and errors
- `HomeView`: Main application view
- `SettingsView`: Settings management view

### State Management

- `@StateObject` for manager instances
- `@State` for view-specific state
- `@Published` for observable properties
- `@ObservedObject` for data binding

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `WallpaperCacheTests`: Cache functionality
- `WallpaperItemTests`: Item functionality
- `WallpaperManagerTests`: Manager functionality

### Performance Tests

- `PerformanceTests`: Performance benchmarks
- Cache hit/miss performance
- Loading performance
- Memory usage

### UI Tests

- View rendering
- User interactions
- Error handling
- Accessibility

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features

- Cache expiration policies
- Memory usage optimization
- Network wallpaper support
- Cloud synchronization

### Potential Optimizations

- Parallel processing
- Compression for cached images
- Predictive loading
- Smart cache eviction
